	<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
	<p>Thomas Edison began his career as a news butcher, selling newspapers, candy and vegetables on the trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. He turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and chemical experiments.[21] At age 15, in 1862, he saved 3-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train.[22] Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.[23] He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments until he left the job rather than be fired after being held responsible for a near collision of two trains.[24][25][26]

Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers.[26] This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. Ultimately, his entrepreneurship was central to the formation of some 14 companies, including General Electric, formerly one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.[27][28]</p>
	<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
	<p>The higher education of Thomas Alva Edison did not include pursuing college or university, he was largely self-taught, or received education through training. He was taught how to operate a telegraph system by J.U. MacKenzie, station agent at Mt. Clemens, Michigan, as an act of gratefulness for the former saving the latter’s three-year-old son from a train accident. He later worked as a telegraph operator, while utilizing his spare time reading and experimenting with telegraph technology.


The development of sound-based signals put him in a disadvantaged position in comparison to others due to his hearing disability. But this became a crucial factor for his early inventions, which focussed on inventing devices by which his disability would not hinder his work. He quit working in telegraphy in 1869 and utilized his time in experimenting with new inventions.</p>

	<p>Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a "freethinker".[53] Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason.[53] Edison defended Paine's "scientific deism", saying, "He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity."[53] In 1878, Edison joined the Theosophical Society in New Jersey,[134] but according to its founder, Helena Blavatsky, he was not a very active member.[135] In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:

Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me—the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love—He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us—nature did it all—not the gods of the religions</p>
	<h3 id="awards">Awards</h3>
	<p>In 1878, Edison was awarded an honorary PhD from Union College[149]
The President of the Third French Republic, Jules Grévy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (Légion d'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881;[150] Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889.[151]
In 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
The Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.[151]
In 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.[152]
He was named an Honorable Consulting Engineer at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's fair in 1904.[151]</p>
	<h3 id="personal-life">Personal life</h3>
	<p>On December 25, 1871, at the age of 24, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855–1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:

Marion Estelle Edison (1873–1965), nicknamed "Dot"[120]
Thomas Alva Edison Jr. (1876–1935), nicknamed "Dash"[121]
William Leslie Edison (1878–1937) Inventor, graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 1900.[122]
Mary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor[123] or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.[124]

Edison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.[40]


Mina Miller Edison in 1906
On February 24, 1886, at the age of 39, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865–1947) in Akron, Ohio.[125] She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:

Madeleine Edison (1888–1979), who married John Eyre Sloane.[126][127]
Charles Edison (1890–1969), Governor of New Jersey (1941–1944), who took over his father's company and experimental laboratories upon his father's death.[128]</p>
